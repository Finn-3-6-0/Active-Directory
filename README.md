# 🖥️ Active Directory Lab in Oracle VirtualBox

A self-contained IT infrastructure lab using **Oracle VirtualBox**, simulating a basic Windows domain with **Active Directory**, **DHCP**, **DNS**, and **internal networking**. This has been great for me for practicing Windows Server administration, domain control, and PowerShell automation. This setup is a simpler version of what you would see in your work or school, where you can take your one username and password and log into many desktops with it.

### 💡 Components:

- **DC (Server19):**  
  - Windows Server 2019  
  - Roles: Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS), DNS, DHCP, and NAT (RRAS)  
  - Dual NICs:  
    - NIC 1: Connected to home network via NAT (DHCP from router)  
    - NIC 2: Internal Network (static IP: `172.16.0.1`)

- **Client1 (Win10):**  
  - Windows 10 VM  
  - Single NIC on Internal Network  
  - Gets IP and DNS from Server via DHCP

## 🌐 Network Configuration

| Component         | IP Address       | Role                         | Notes                      |
|------------------|------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------|
| DC (Internal NIC) | `172.16.0.1`     | DHCP, DNS, AD DS             | Gateway for Client         |
| DC (Internet NIC) | DHCP from router | External internet access     | Uses NAT via RRAS          |
| Client1           | `172.16.0.x`     | Domain-joined client (DHCP)  | Receives IP from DC        |

### 🧾 DHCP Scope (configured on DC):

- **Range:** `172.16.0.100` – `172.16.0.200`  
- **Subnet Mask:** `255.255.255.0`  
- **Gateway:** `172.16.0.1`  
- **DNS:** `172.16.0.1`
