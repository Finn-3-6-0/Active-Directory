# üñ•Ô∏è Active Directory Lab in Oracle VirtualBox

This lab was built using **Oracle VirtualBox**, simulating a basic Windows domain with **Active Directory**. This has been great for me for practicing Windows Server administration, domain control, and PowerShell automation. This setup is a simplified version of what you would find in your work or school, where you can take your one username and password and log into multiple desktops with it.

Coming soon...
